## ZÃ¼s Overview 

[Zus](https://zus.network/) is the first S3-compatible storage platform thatâ€™s fast, secure, and ACID-compliant operating on a zero-trust network.
Our goal is to deliver 10x value to customers through:

- 5x better performance
- 2x lower costs, thanks to zero egress and API fees (for non-cloud deployments), and lower security and compute costs.
- 2x lower carbon footprint, enabled by our erasure-coded architecture
- Breachproof security with split-key, zero-knowledge, and erasure coded data
- 100% dynamic availability, with ability to add or replace servers on the fly
- Vendor neutrality, with no lock-in or dependency on a single storage provider
- One of our customers benchmarked our platform against AWS on [s3compare.io](https://s3compare.io) showing 5x performance gains.

### Core Features â€“ ZÃ¼s vs AWS S3 vs MinIO

| **Feature**                              | **AWS S3**                                          | **MinIO**                                      | **ZÃ¼s**                                                                                   |

## Configuration

**Prerequisites**

- Have a wallet and allocation on ZÃ¼s. Allocation can be created through [Blimp](blimp.software) or [Vult](vult.network)
    - Unsure how to recover a wallet and allocation using the CLI, check steps 1-3 here: https://docs.zus.network/zus-docs/clis
- Have your wallet.json in ~/.zcn
```json
{"client_id":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
"client_key":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
"keys":[{"public_key":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
"private_key":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"}],
"mnemonics":"xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxx",
"version":"1.0","date_created":"2023-05-03T12:44:46+05:30","nonce":0,"is_split":false}
```
- Have your config.yaml in ~/.zcn
```yaml
block_worker: https://mainnet.zus.network/dns
signature_scheme: bls0chain
min_submit: 50 # in percentage
min_confirmation: 50 # in percentage
confirmation_chain_length: 3
```
## Installation & Setup

This section guides you through cloning, building, and configuring rclone_zus with the ZÃ¼s backend.
### 1. Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/0chain/rclone_zus.git
    cd rclone_zus

### 2. Build the Rclone Binary

Use the provided Makefile to build the project:

    make

This will compile the rclone binary into the project root (./rclone), including the ZÃ¼s backend.

ðŸ’¡ Troubleshooting: If make fails (e.g., missing make command or incompatible system), you can build manually:

    go build -o rclone ./rclone.go

Ensure you have Go â‰¥1.20 installed (suggested go 1.23.4)and your GOPATH properly configured.

This will build a local ./rclone binary with the ZÃ¼s backend integrated.

Note: If you're modifying backend code (e.g. backend/zus/zus.go), you can recompile by running the go build command again.

### 3. (Optional) Install as Global Command rclone_zus

To use your custom Rclone binary without the ./ prefix, install it globally by copying it to a directory in your system's $PATH, such as /usr/local/bin:

    sudo cp ./rclone /usr/local/bin/rclone_zus

After this, you can run it from anywhere as a normal command:

    rclone_zus move TestZus:/source TestZus:/dest

ðŸ“Œ Why rename it?

Renaming it to rclone_zus helps avoid conflicts with the system-installed rclone, if present.

### 4. Configure ZÃ¼s SDK

Ensure the following ZÃ¼s config files are present in `~/.zcn/`:

- `wallet.json` â€“ ZÃ¼s wallet
- `config.yaml` â€“ ZÃ¼s network configuration
- `allocation.txt` â€“ Your allocation ID (64-character hex string)

You can generate these using:

- [ZÃ¼s CLI](https://docs.zus.network/zus-docs/clis)
- [Vult UI](https://vult.network)
- [Blimp Web UI](https://blimp.software)

**Remote Cofiguration**

Here is an example of how to make a `zus` remote called `myZus`.

First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> myZus
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
...
59 / Zus Decentralized Storage
   \ "zus"
...
Storage> zus
Zus Allocation ID - allocation ID.
allocation_id>
Config Directory - directory to read config files (defaults to ~/.zcn; make sure to use the correct windows path for  `C:\Users\Username\.zcn`).
config_dir>
Work Directory - directory to read/write files.
work_dir>
Encrypt - encrypt the data before uploading.
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: zus
- allocation_id: allocation_id
Keep this "myZus" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Make sure your rclone.conf file is created.
- For Windows, check %APPDATA%\rclone\rclone.conf. If you downloaded the rclone.exe, you can place the rclone.conf in the same directory as the .exe.
- For macOS/Linux, check ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf

Example rclone.conf :
```ini
[myZus]
type = zus
allocation_id = <allocation_id>
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd <remote name>:<absolute path>

Example to list all the files and directories inside the root directory of the remote "myZus"

    rclone lsd myZus:/

Output example:

```
    -1 2025-05-14 15:27:59        -1 Encrypted
    -1 2025-07-12 17:25:15        -1 10MbFiles100
    -1 2025-07-12 17:44:35        -1 10MbFiles100M
    -1 2025-07-12 17:46:51        -1 project-zus
    -1 2025-07-14 22:45:57        -1 10MbFiles50
```

Make a new directory (This example shows new directory name as "directory")

    rclone mkdir myZus:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls myZus:directory

**Copy** from source to destination `(Local to Remote, Remote to Remote, Remote to Local)`

    rclone copy <remote name>:<source path> <remote name>:<destination path>    
    
Example

    rclone copy myZus:/sourcefilesDir/ myZus:/destinationDir/


**Move** from source to destination `(Local to Remote, Remote to Remote, Remote to Local)`

    rclone move <remote name>:<source path> <remote name>:<destination path>    
    
Example

    rclone move myZus:/sourcefilesDir/ myZus:/destinationDir/

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory myZus:directory

You can also check your allocation in the Blimp and Vult UI. Files should be in a folder named "directory".


## Sync Mode Configuration
### Use sync mode in rclone_zus for bulk operations

use `--transfers=number of operations | --transfers=50` with the commands.

```
Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> y

Option sdk_log_level.
Log level for the SDK
Enter a signed integer. Press Enter for the default (0).
sdk_log_level> leave empty

Option batch_mode.
Upload file batching sync|async|off.
This sets the batch mode used by rclone.
zusThis has 3 possible values
- off - no batching
- sync - batch uploads and check completion (default)
- async - batch upload and don't check completion
Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make
a delay on quit.
Enter a value of type string. Press Enter for the default (sync).
batch_mode> leave empty

Option batch_size.
Max number of files in upload batch.
This sets the batch size of files to upload. It has to be less than 50.
By default this is 0 which means rclone will calculate the batch size
depending on the setting of batch_mode.
- batch_mode: async - default batch_size is 100
- batch_mode: sync - default batch_size is the same as --transfers
- batch_mode: off - not in use
Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make
a delay on quit.
Setting this is a great idea if you are uploading lots of small files
as it will make them a lot quicker. You can use --transfers 32 to
maximise throughput.
Enter a signed integer. Press Enter for the default (0).
batch_size> 50

Option batch_timeout.
Max time to allow an idle upload batch before uploading.
If an upload batch is idle for more than this long then it will be
uploaded.
The default for this is 0 which means rclone will choose a sensible
default based on the batch_mode in use.
- batch_mode: async - default batch_timeout is 5s
- batch_mode: sync - default batch_timeout is 500ms
- batch_mode: off - not in use
Enter a duration s,m,h,d,w,M,y. Press Enter for the default (0s).
batch_timeout> leave empty

Option batch_commit_timeout.
Max time to wait for a batch to finish committing
Enter a duration s,m,h,d,w,M,y. Press Enter for the default (10m0s).
batch_commit_timeout> leave empty

Option description.
Description of the remote.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
description> leave empty

Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n

Configuration complete.
```
